  "checked": true,
  "image_path": "D:\\ai image\\ai-image-trust-scanner\\data\\day10_format_control\\ai\\jpeg_q95\\ai_028__jpeg_q95.jpg",
  "ai_probability": 0.5,
  "model_name": "v0.1-baseline-placeholder",
  "model_status": "placeholder",
  "note": "No deep model is trained or loaded in V0.1. This neutral value is placeholder metadata and is not used as trained evidence.",
  "error": null
}
```

## Evidence Summary

- No EXIF found; this is only a weak provenance signal.
- Basic forensic features did not trigger strong baseline warnings.
- Frequency score is a weak heuristic based on high-frequency energy, not a final judgment.
- Deep model detector is placeholder and is not used as trained evidence.

## Limitation Note

This is AI Image Trust Scanner V0.1 baseline output. It combines simple metadata, forensic, frequency, and placeholder model signals. It is not a final detection conclusion and should not be treated as proof that an image is real or AI-generated.
